/*

You are given a sequence of distinct positive numbers that you need to insert into an empty Binary 
Tree (following the order of insertion that we discussed for it in the class i.e. from left to right). 
In the tree thus constructed you need to find any subtree which is a valid Binary Search Tree 
(BST) and the sum of all the node values of this BST equal to X. Consider the following Binary 
Tree 
 
You can easily identify that a sub-tree from node 17 19 21 form a valid BST whose node sum is 
57. 

Input file format: The first line of the input file input file contains number of nodes in Binary 
Tree (say n), the second line contains the sum required to produce for any valid BST (say s). From 
the next line you will get values of each n nodes. You need to insert each value in an empty Binary 
Tree (BT). The tree thus formed is used to find a subtree which is a valid Binary Search and the 
sum of all the nodes included in the BST sums to X. A sample input is given below: 

Output file format: The output file contains node values which sums to X.
